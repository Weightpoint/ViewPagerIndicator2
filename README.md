# ViewPagerIndicator2
An (mildly) improved [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ViewPagerIndicator), originally by Jake Wharton

## Changes from ViewPagerIndicator
1. Build with Gradle as opposed to Maven; Works with [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/).
2. Uses `Math` instead of `FloatMath`, thus this library works on Andrid API lvl 23

## To Install
Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
  	...
  	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

Add the dependency
```groovy
dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.jrejaud:ViewPagerIndicator2:0.0.2'
}
```
Visit https://jitpack.io/#jrejaud/ViewPagerIndicator2 for more information.

## Usage
See https://github.com/JakeWharton/ViewPagerIndicator#usage for instructions on how to use ViewPagerIndicator.
You just need to change the path (in Java and XML) to:

```groovy
com.github.jrejaud.viewpagerindicator2;
```

instead of 

```java
com.viewpagerindicator;
```
