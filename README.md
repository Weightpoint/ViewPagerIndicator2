# ViewPagerIndicator2
An (mildly) improved [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ViewPagerIndicator), originally by Jake Wharton

## Changes
1. Build with Gradle as opposed to Maven, So it works with [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/).
2. Uses `Math` instead of `FloatMath`, thus it works on Andrid API lvl 23

## To Install
Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
  	...
  	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.jrejaud:ViewPagerIndicator2:0.0.1'
}
```
Visit https://jitpack.io/#jrejaud/ViewPagerIndicator2 for more instructions

## Usage
See https://github.com/JakeWharton/ViewPagerIndicator#usage for instructions on how to use ViewPagerIndicator.
You just need to change the path (in Java and XML) to:

```
com.github.jrejaud.viewpagerindicator2;
```

instead of 

```
com.viewpagerindicator;
```
